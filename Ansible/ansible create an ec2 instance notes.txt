Ansible ec2 instance creation playbook:

Requirements:

Step 1:
AWS login - free tier
IAM Key and Secret
Import/export keys
Ansible on Linux
Install boto3 (  pip install boto )

Step 2:
create a boto file:
touch ~/.boto
vi ~/.boto
[Credentials]
aws_access_key_id = {{ your values }}
aws_secret_access_key = {{ your values }}

Step 3:
ssh key
download you public ssh-key file "id_rsa.pub" from /root/.ssh/ folder to your computer
login to aws and import the id_rsa.pub key to ec2 => Key Pairs => Import Key pair

if you don't have a ssk key create one on your ansible server by typing following command and accept all defaults

ssh-keygen

now check folder /root/.ssh/ you will find id_rsa.pub file

Step 4:
Create a playbook

vi ec2instance.yaml

copy and paste following and change values as needed:( pay attention to keypair, region, image values may change for your enviromnet)

--- # creating a ec2 instance in AWS using ansible
- name: create a ec2 isnatnce
  hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  gather_facts: False
  vars:
    keypair: id_rsa
    instance_type: t2.micro
    image: ami-11aa8c74
    region: us-east-2
  tasks:
    - name: create a ec2 instance
      ec2:
         key_name: '{{ keypair }}'
         group: default
         instance_type: '{{ instance_type }}'
         image: '{{ image }}'
         wait: true
         region: '{{ region }}'
         count: 1
      register: ec2

-----------------------

We can also create a playbook to delete any instance.

However do this quickly deleting this via AWS CLI:

command:
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids  i-04c1d558b78974aee
